# Word Counter
Thanks for checking out my repo. Live app view is no longer supported...I built this in 2018 and I stopped paying to keep it up.

This app will allow a user to keep a list of words they know and rate how well they know them.
	
* Sort by word, assessment, or number of exposures to the word
* Add words by pasting any block of text by clicking the green '+' (uses Google NLP)
* remove any words that were added by clicking the 'x'

## Technology
Javascript, HTML, CSS, Express, Node

## Built With

* [Google Natural Language Processing](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) - To parse text into individual words and to convert words from their inflected form to their lemma.
* [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/) - To look up a word's definition on the entrance page
